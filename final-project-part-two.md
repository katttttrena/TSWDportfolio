# Wireframes / storyboards
The story is titled "The International Student's American Dream: A Data Story" and will be constructed as a guided narrative using Tableau's "Story Points" feature. The flow follows the journey from ambition (high enrollment) to conflict (visa cap) to personal reality (low odds).

# User research 
## Target audience
My primary audiences are the following two groups of people:
1. Current and Potential International Students: They need to analyze and understand the landscape of the H-1B Visa, so they can manage their expectations and career paths.
2. Policymakers and Immigration Advocates: They require clear, data-based evidence to interpret the systemic pressures caused by the visa cap on international students.

My approach to identifying representative individuals was to select from each of these primary groups: a student currently in the pipeline, a professional who successfully navigated the process, and a policy-aware advocate.

## Interview script
The general goal is to test the narrative's clarity, emotional effectiveness, and completeness by collecting feedback on the visualizations and overall story flow.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Clarity|Do the visualizations clearly communicate the intended problem?|
|Relevance|After seeing the 'Odds of Success' chart, what action or thought process would you immediately consider?|
|Completeness|Is there any crucial element missing from this story about the international student journey?|
|Tone|Does the story's progression feel logical and engaging, or does it feel overly negative/complex?|

| Questions               | Interview 1 (International Student) | Interview 2（Hiring Manager） | Interview 3（General Audience） |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Do the visualizations clearly communicate the intended problem?|The first chart's y-axis is unclear—is "250" 250,000 students?|The widening gap in the H-1B chart is very powerful.|The connection between low unemployment and low selection rate is a bit complex.|
|After seeing the third chart, what action or thought process would you immediately consider?|I would immediately consider applying for jobs in Canada or other countries with clearer immigration paths.|I'd think about the cost and difficulty of sponsoring a candidate and the high chance of them not getting the visa.|I would want to know what the visa selection criteria are, or if there's a different visa option.|
|Is there any crucial element missing from this story about the international student journey?|The story desperately needs to mention the tuition and living costs—it makes the risk so much greater.|It's missing what happens after rejection, like being forced to leave within 60 days.|Is there any hope? What are the alternatives to the H-1B lottery?|
|Does the story's progression feel logical and engaging, or does it feel overly negative/complex?|It's logical, but it feels like a tragedy.|The progression is logical: enrollment up → visa down. The tone is appropriate for the severity of the problem.|It would be better if you can include a Call-to-Action page.|


# Identified changes for Part III
The planned changes will focus on clarifying the data, enhancing the emotional impact by adding financial context, and strengthening the "Call to Action" by offering solution-oriented context.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Y-Axis Clarity Issue (Interview 1)| Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation.|Change the 'New International Enrollment' y-axis labels (Page 3) to explicitly include thousands (e.g., "250K" instead of "250") or add a footnote stating the units are in thousands.|
|Inverse Relationship Explanation (Interview 3)|Revise the text accompanying the 'Trend Comparison' chart (Page 5) to more clearly articulate: Low unemployment → high demand for workers → more H-1B registrations → lower selection rate due to fixed visa caps.|
| Call to Action (Interview 3)| Add a call-to-action page to the presentation.|
|Add a slide/callout at the beginning of Page 4 to quantify the average cost of a U.S. graduate degree (the primary H-1B applicants). This will strengthen the emotional narrative of risk vs. reward.| Add a dataset related to living cost.|

The core data story is sound, successfully demonstrating the supply-and-demand crisis in the international student career path. The identified changes are mainly focused on making the data more accessible to a general audience (clarity on units), enriching the emotional context (cost of education), and providing a more action-oriented conclusion, which will complete the story arc from problem to potential solution.
