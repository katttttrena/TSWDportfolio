# Wireframes / storyboards
The story is titled "The International Student's American Dream: A Data Story" and will be constructed as a guided narrative using Tableau's "Story Points" feature. The flow follows the journey from ambition (high enrollment) to conflict (visa cap) to personal reality (low odds).

# User research 

## Target audience
My primary audiences are the following two groups of people:
1. Current and Potential International Students: They need to analyze and understand the landscape of the H-1B Visa, so they can manage their expectations and career paths.
2. Policymakers and Immigration Advocates: They require clear, data-based evidence to interpret the systemic pressures caused by the visa cap on international students.

My approach to identifying representative individuals was to select from each of these primary groups: a student currently in the pipeline, a professional who successfully navigated the process, and a policy-aware advocate.

## Interview script
The general goal is to test the narrative's clarity, emotional effectiveness, and completeness by collecting feedback on the visualizations and overall story flow.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Clarity|Do the visualizations clearly communicate the intended problem?|
|Relevance|After seeing the 'Odds of Success' chart, what action or thought process would you immediately consider?|
|Completeness|Is there any crucial element missing from this story about the international student journey?|
|Tone|Does the story's progression feel logical and engaging, or does it feel overly negative/complex?|
