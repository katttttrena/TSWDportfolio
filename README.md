# About me
Hi there! My name is Jun Wang, and I'm currently a graduate student in the M.S. in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics program at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are she/her. My background is in economics and data science, and I'm passionate about using data to uncover meaningful insights and communicate them effectively.

# What I hope to learn
I'm excited to dive deeper into the art of data visualization and learn how to create compelling visual narratives. My goal for this course is to strengthen my skills in tools like Tableau and to master the principles of effective data storytelling. 

I want to build a portfolio of projects that not only present data but also engage an audience and drive understanding. 

After graduation, I plan to pursue a career as a data analyst or data scientist, where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems and help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Final project
This project, "The International Student's American Dream: A Data Story," explores the increasingly difficult career path for international students in the United States. While U.S. universities attract a growing number of talented individuals from around the globe, the post-graduation landscape presents a formidable challenge. The core of this story lies in the stark contrast between the promise of a world-class American education and the reality of securing a work visa in a highly competitive environment.Through a narrative-driven data visualization, this project will weave together data on rising international student enrollment, the staggering financial investment required, and the slim, lottery-based odds of obtaining an H-1B work visa. The goal is to provide a data-backed perspective on the immense pressures and uncertainties facing this ambitious group. The target audience includes prospective international students seeking to manage their expectations, current students navigating their career options, and policymakers or advocates interested in U.S. immigration and labor market dynamics.
