# About me
Hi there! My name is Jun Wang, and I'm currently a graduate student in the M.S. in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics program at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are she/her. My background is in economics and data science, and I'm passionate about using data to uncover meaningful insights and communicate them effectively.

# What I hope to learn
I'm excited to dive deeper into the art of data visualization and learn how to create compelling visual narratives. My goal for this course is to strengthen my skills in tools like Tableau and to master the principles of effective data storytelling. 

I want to build a portfolio of projects that not only present data but also engage an audience and drive understanding. 

After graduation, I plan to pursue a career as a data analyst or data scientist, where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems and help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.
