  My journey to redesign the Marvel movie visualization began with a personal interest in the topic and a strong conviction that the original chart had significant flaws. The initial visualization, a cluttered bubble chart, was hard to interpret. Its title was vague, and the data points were so bunched together that it was nearly impossible to identify individual movies or draw meaningful conclusions. The long, disconnected legend and the lack of a clear narrative made the chart feel like a chaotic data dump rather than an informative tool. I knew I could transform it into something that was not only visually appealing but also genuinely useful

  My first attempt at a redesign focused on simplifying the story. I decided to change the visualization to a scatter plot that showed a movie's financial performance (measured as percentage of budget recovered) over time. During an in-class critique, my peers offered invaluable feedback that highlighted a crucial blind spot: my familiarity with the data made me miss what was obvious to a fresh pair of eyes. They pointed out that my axis names were confusing, the movie titles were missing from the data points, and the title of the chart could be more direct. This user feedback was the most important part of my process. It taught me that a visualization's success isn't about what the creator knows, but about what a new audience can instantly understand.
  
  The final visualization is a direct result of that feedback. I implemented several key changes to create a more user-centered design. I gave the chart a clear, action-oriented title: "Marvel Movies: A Comparison of Audience Score, Gross Profit, and Budget" I then added a subtitle with an explicit instruction: "USE THE LEGEND TO FILTER." This transforms the static legend from the original chart into an interactive tool, allowing users to select specific movie series to filter the data. I also corrected the usability issues my peers identified by adding movie titles directly to each data point and renaming the axes to be more intuitive. This new design successfully transforms a jumbled collection of data into a clean, interactive tool that tells a compelling story about a movie's financial performance relative to its release year, allowing users to easily identify which films were the most successful.
