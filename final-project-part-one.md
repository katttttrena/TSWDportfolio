##Final Project Outline: The International Student's American Dream - A Data Story

#High-Level Summary
>This project will explore the increasingly challenging career path for international students in the United States. Through a narrative-driven data visualization, I aim to tell a compelling story about how rising international student aspirations, a competitive job market, and a highly selective H1B visa lottery have created a gauntlet for those seeking to build a career in the U.S. By integrating official data on student enrollment, H1B registration numbers, and national unemployment rates, the project will reveal a stark contrast between the promise of an American education and the reality of the post-graduation professional landscape. The target audience is prospective international students, current students, and anyone interested in immigration and labor market trends.
>The core message of the project is that the "American Dream" for international students is becoming a high-stakes numbers game. The project will show how a steady increase in international student enrollment over the past decade has collided with a volatile H1B lottery, leading to a significant decrease in the probability of securing a work visa. This story will provide a data-backed perspective on the challenges and choices facing this ambitious group.
>One-Sentence Summary: Through a timeline of international student enrollment, U.S. unemployment, and H1B lottery data, this project tells a story of increasing competition and diminishing odds for international graduates seeking a career in the U.S.

#User Stories:
>As a prospective international student, I want to see the historical trends of H1B visas so I can realistically assess my chances of working in the U.S. after graduation.
As a current international student, I want to understand the current visa landscape and how my job prospects are tied to broader economic and immigration policies.
As an immigration advocate, I want a clear, data-driven narrative to demonstrate the challenges and inefficiencies of the current U.S. work visa system.

# The data
> H1B Registration and Selection Data: I will manually collect historical data from the USCIS website's annual news releases and alerts. This involves navigating to specific fiscal year updates and compiling the number of registrations and selections into a CSV file. The file will be uploaded to my GitHub repository.
> International Student Enrollment Data: I will use the "Open Doors Data" portal provided by the Institute of International Education (IIE). The website offers downloadable datasets that I can use to track enrollment numbers by academic level and field of study over time. A direct link to the data portal will be provided.
> U.S. Unemployment Rate Data: I will source this data from the Macrotrends website, which compiles historical data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This data is available in a clean table format that can be easily copied and pasted or scraped into a CSV. A link to the specific data page will be included.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
