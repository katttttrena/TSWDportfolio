##Final Project Outline: The International Student's American Dream - A Data Story

#High-Level Summary
>This project will explore the increasingly challenging career path for international students in the United States. Through a narrative-driven data visualization, I aim to tell a compelling story about how rising international student aspirations, a competitive job market, and a highly selective H1B visa lottery have created a gauntlet for those seeking to build a career in the U.S. By integrating official data on student enrollment, H1B registration numbers, and national unemployment rates, the project will reveal a stark contrast between the promise of an American education and the reality of the post-graduation professional landscape. The target audience is prospective international students, current students, and anyone interested in immigration and labor market trends.
>The core message of the project is that the "American Dream" for international students is becoming a high-stakes numbers game. The project will show how a steady increase in international student enrollment over the past decade has collided with a volatile H1B lottery, leading to a significant decrease in the probability of securing a work visa. This story will provide a data-backed perspective on the challenges and choices facing this ambitious group.
>One-Sentence Summary: Through a timeline of international student enrollment, U.S. unemployment, and H1B lottery data, this project tells a story of increasing competition and diminishing odds for international graduates seeking a career in the U.S.

#User Stories:
>As a prospective international student, I want to see the historical trends of H1B visas so I can realistically assess my chances of working in the U.S. after graduation.
As a current international student, I want to understand the current visa landscape and how my job prospects are tied to broader economic and immigration policies.
As an immigration advocate, I want a clear, data-driven narrative to demonstrate the challenges and inefficiencies of the current U.S. work visa system.
